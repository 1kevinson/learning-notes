## Basic idea

-   Grid with horizontal **rows** and vertical **columns**
    -   Row height and column width can be different per row/column
-   Gaps between each row and between each column called **gutters**

Grid is enabled at the level of the container by setting `display: grid;` on it

## Use cases

Grids are a good option whenever you want to define a two-dimensional layout for your page.

Example (with indication of rows and columns as shown by [Firefox Grid Inspector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Examine_grid_layouts)):
