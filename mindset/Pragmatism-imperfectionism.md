## Pragmatism

-   Work in a way this is practical and sensible given the circumstances, even if it's different from the theoretical "ideal way"
-   Focus on what actually gets the job done for your particular project and case, in a way that's good enough in your context
-   One size doesn't fit all

## Don't expect perfection

-   Don't expect perfection from **yourself**
    -   Just like any other human, you are not perfect
    -   You will write code that is not bug-free
    -   You will write code that takes shortcuts, doesn't follow some of the project's conventions or is not clear about its intended purpose
    -   You will solve problems in suboptimal ways
    -   You will fail to see things that are obvious in hindsight
    -   You will lack knowledge on some topics that others know a lot more about and that maybe even seem like essential knowledge
    -   You will communicate in confusing ways or fail to communicate important information
    -   You will misunderstand your colleagues, even if what they say is sensible and clear
-   Don't expect perfection from your **colleagues**
    -   Just like any other human, your colleagues are not perfect
    -   Everything that's listed above? Your colleagues will do that too.
-   Don't expect perfection from your **codebase**
    -   Your codebase was likely written under time pressure and based on changing requirements, with everyone working on it an imperfect human
    -   There will be technical debt and not all of it will ever get fixed
    -   There will be things that don't make sense given the current situation but are impossible or impractical to change
-   Don't expect perfection from your **process**
    -   There will be communication overhead
    -   There will be unclear and changing requirements
    -   There will be situations where team members are blocking each other
    -   There will be situations where team members unknowingly perform duplicate or conflicting work
    -   There will be decisions that later turn out to be suboptimal because you didn't have the right info, knowledge, experience or priorities at the time

## Imperfectionist mindset

### Be humble

-   Realize that you are imperfect, just like everyone around you
-   See also the previous section

### Own your mistakes

-   Since you are not perfect, it is expected that you make mistakes
    -   Mistakes you make in _specific_ situations do not imply that you are not good at what you do _in general_
    -   It feels great to realize this and get comfortable admitting your mistakes
-   Rather than trying to hide your mistakes, admit them and give honest information about what happened. Bonus points if you already have ideas on how to solve the problem.
-   Instead of ruminating about mistakes you have made, put that time and energy into fixing the situation or preventing the mistake from happening again
-   People who admit their mistakes come across as more confident, reliable and relatable than those who pretend to be perfect

### Prefer incremental improvement over sudden perfection

-   Focus on consistently making progress or adding value
-   Start from the way things actually are, not from the way you wish they were
-   Incremental improvement gives you early feedback on whether you're moving in the right direction
-   Incremental improvement is often a lot more practical than sudden huge changes
    -   Example: First writing a working "first draft" of the code and then improving its readability can be a lot more effective than trying to write perfectly clean code immediately
    -   Example: When introducing stricter coding standards to an existing project, changing all the existing code is often not practical or justifiable. But, if you apply the new standards whenever you write new code or touch an existing piece of code, all parts of the codebase that are under active development will soon follow the new standards
-   Big goals are daunting. Instead, chop the work up into small steps and follow the process, focusing on one step at a time.
-   There is often a compounding where early progress makes future progress easier
    -   Example: Successfully setting up basic automated linting makes it easy to add more strict/advanced rules later on
    -   Example: When learning, properly understanding basic concepts makes it a lot easier to understand more advanced concepts later on

### Consider going for imperfect action now instead of possibly perfect action in the future

-   Taking a good enough action means improvement, not taking action means no improvement
    -   "Great is the enemy of good"
    -   Good code shipped today is often better than perfect code shipped next week
-   Often, the experience you gain from taking action teaches you a lot more about what works well and what doesn't than just theorizing about what would be the best approach. See also [Quantity Always Trumps Quality](https://blog.codinghorror.com/quantity-always-trumps-quality/)
-   Definitely don't wait for perfect circumstances, as they will likely never come

### Focus on solutions rather than problems

-   Software development is all about problem solving
    -   Your real value is in delivering solutions, not problems
-   Often, problems don't even need to be solved in order to make progress despite them
    -   A lot of problems are not showstoppers
    -   In a lot of situations, a workaround or partial solution is enough
    -   Sometimes, it even makes sense to simply ignore the problem
-   Rather than focusing on the problem, focus on finding possible solutions or at least paths that lead towards possible solutions
    -   Problems that seem unfixable at first sight are likely to be fixable once you really think about it
-   Looking at the big picture helps to find solutions or workarounds that may not be obvious if you focus too closely on the problem
