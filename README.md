This is a collection of my notes regarding things I have learned over the years. These notes will serve two main purposes:

- Allow me to quickly get back up to speed on a subject that I investigated before
- Help me structure my thoughts as I am learning new things

Each note will typically include a summary of the most important ideas regarding the subject (either in my own words or by quoting other people) and then refer to additional sources for more details.
