This is a collection of my notes regarding things I have learned over the years. These notes will serve two main purposes:

- Allow me to quickly get back up to speed on a subject that I investigated before
- Help me structure my thoughts as I am learning new things

In the past, I have tried to set up a blog for the same purpose. However, I was spending a lot of time turning my findings into coherent, decent-length posts (not my main goal) while I actually wanted to spend that time learning and playing around (my main goal).

Each note will include a summary of the most important ideas regarding the subject (either in my own words or by quoting other people) and then refer to additional sources for more details.
