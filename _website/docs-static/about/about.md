title: About these notes
---

This is a collection of my notes regarding things I have learned over the years. 

Each note will provide some useful resources regarding the topic plus a summary of the most important points. The summary is typically useful for getting a higher-level understanding or refreshing your memory. Sometimes, it also contains some additional insights or remarks. If you want more details, you can use the start of the note as a curated list of resources.

The actual notes are versioned in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/mistermicheels/learning-notes). This website is generated from those notes using the lovely [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) plus a bunch of custom scripts that are also in the repository. The generated site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and search is powered by [Algolia's DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/).
