title: About these notes
---

This is a collection of my notes regarding things I have learned over the years. 

Each note will provide some useful resources regarding the topic plus a summary of the most important points. The summary is typically useful for getting a higher-level understanding or refreshing your memory. Sometimes, it also contains some additional insights or remarks. If you want more details, you can use the start of the note as a curated list of resources.

The actual notes are versioned in <a href="https://github.com/mistermicheels/learning-notes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this GitHub repository <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>. This website is generated from those notes using the lovely <a href="https://v2.docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> plus a bunch of custom scripts that are also in the repository. The generated site is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Netlify <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> and search is powered by <a href="https://docsearch.algolia.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Algolia's DocSearch <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>.
