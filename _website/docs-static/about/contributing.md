Some goals I had when creating these notes:

-   Allow me to quickly get back up to speed on a subject that I investigated before
-   Help me structure my thoughts as I am learning new things

In order for those goals to be achieved, it's important that I am the only one writing these notes. Therefore, I will not accept any contributions to the repository (with the exception of minor spelling, grammar and attribution fixes).

If you want to build upon my work, feel free to fork the repository or use the text in any other way while providing proper attribution (a link to this website or [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/mistermicheels/learning-notes) is sufficient).
